# Welcome to Catheedral.

This repository contains the source code for Catheedral - an app that works with Home Assistant to provide another interface to the most important parts of your smart home.  Catheedral was developed using [TMS WEB Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcore.asp) from [TMS Software](https://www.tmssoftware.com), along with their [Miletus Framework](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=775).  More details about this project can also be found on the TMS Software Blog, starting with this [first post](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=1044).

TMS WEB Core is a framework that uses Delphi, Visual Studio Code, or Lazarus to transpile Delphi/Pascal code into 100% native JavaScript, HTML and CSS code.  Miletus is a framework, similiar to Electron, that creates platform-specific binaries, supporting Windows, macOS, Linux and Raspberry Pi.  Catheedral has been created in part to run natively on a Raspberry Pi in an embedded context - much like a smart thermostat or a smart panel for your home, while also supporting the usual desktop-style deployments.

As a modern web application, many additional JavaScript libraries/dependencies have been used in this project.  
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - No introduction needed
- [Tabulator](https://www.tabulator.info) - Fantastic tables
- [Font Awesome](https://www.fontawesome.com) - The very best icons
- [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) - Used throughout Home Assistant
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) - For handling date/time conversions
- [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) - Web components, particularly the color picker for lights
- [Peity Vanilla JS](https://github.com/railsjazz/peity_vanilla) - Fast and simple charts
- [Meteocons](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons) - Animated Weather Icons by [Bas Milius](https://bas.dev/)
