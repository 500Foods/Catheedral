<div class="HelpTitle">Lighting</div>
<div class="HelpBody">
This page shows all of the lights that Catheedral has picked up from Home Assistant.  Here, lights can be toggled on or off by clicking any of the light buttons.<br />
<br />
On the left, there are additional buttons for turning all the lights on or off at once, as well as for viewing either all buttons and groups, just the groups, or just the lights that are not part of a group.  The light count on the Home page reflects individual lights and doesn't include the groups. This is also the default view for this page.<br />
<br />
If you wish to change the color of a light or a light group, click the <i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i>Change button in the top-right corner.  This will enable the "Change Mode" where clicking on a light button brings up a list of options for that light.  This may include RGB colors, brightness, or just on/off depending on the capabilities of the light or light group chosen.
