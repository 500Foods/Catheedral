Weather in Catheedral consists potentially of three separate pages - Forecast, Radar, and Satellite.<br />
<br />
The Forecast page shows hourly and daily forecast information as supplied by the Home Assistant weather integration used.  This may include other forecast information, like probability of precipitation estimates, or even forecast precipitation amounts. Forecast periods are limited by whatever data is available, so be sure to check the integration with Home Assistant if data appears to be missing.<br />
<br />
The Radar and Satellite imagery is typically provided by <a href="https://www.rainviewer.com" target="_blank">RainViewer</a>.  Using their site, a specific location (and zoom level) can be set.  The URL provided inside their "Embed" link can be set in the Catheedral configuration (just the URL is needed). Note that diffrent locations or zoom levels can be used for each of the two available links.<br />
