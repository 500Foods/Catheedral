<div class="HelpTitle">Main Buttons</div>
<div class="HelpBody">
There are four buttons, one in each corner, that are always visible within Catheedral.  These are referred to as <span class="HelpHighlight">Main 
Buttons</span>.<br />
<br /> 
The <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question pe-1"></i>Help</span> button in the top left corner will present you with information related to 
the 
page 
you're currently 
viewing.  You can also view other <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question pe-1"></i>Help</span>  pages by using the <span 
class="HelpHighlight">Navigation Controls</span> while viewing any <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question pe-1"></i>Help</span> 
page.<br 
/>
<br />
The <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-shuffle pe-1"></i>Change</span> button in the top right corner provides access to additional settings for the 
page.  In some instances, this will change to a <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-rotate-right pe-1"></i>Refresh</span> button that will allow you to 
reload 
that particular page.<br />
<br />
The <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-home pe-1"></i>Home</span> button in the bottom right corner will bring you back to the Catheedral Home 
page.  If you're already on 
the 
Catheedral 
Home page, this changes to a <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-bolt pe-1"></i>Connected</span>  button, which can be used to reset the 
connection 
between Catheedral and your Home Assistant server. If the connection between Catheedral and your Home Assistant server is lost, this will change to a <span 
class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation pe-1 text-warning"></i>Disconnected</span> button.<br />
<br />
The <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-gear pe-1"></i>Configuration</span> button in the bottom left corner brings up additional pages that allow you 
to 
make changes to how Catheedral works.  If you're already on the <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-gear pe-1"></i>Configuration</span> page, this 
button will instead change to a <span class="HelpHighlight"><i class="fa-solid fa-power-off pe-1"></i>Power Off</span> button that will allow you to exit the 
Catheedral 
application completely.
