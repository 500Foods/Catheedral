This page is used to view additional Configuration Information in case you need to troubleshoot a problem.<br />
<br />
The first column shows values that are specific to the Cathedral app and are generated without interacting with the Home Assistant Server. The Internet address 
indicated is the public IP Address as seen from the device that this Cathedral app is running on.  If this value is 'unknown' 
or 'undefined', then the Internet was inaccessible when the Cathedral app first started.<br />
<br />
The remaining two columns reflect data coming from the Home Assistant Server.  If any of these values are incorrect, unknown, or undefined, they will need to be 
updated directly within Home Assistant.  Subsequent changes can be reflected here by restarting the Cathedral app or by refreshing it from the main Configuration 
screen using the "Refresh" icon in the top-right corner.
