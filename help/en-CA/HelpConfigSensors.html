<div class="HelpTitle">Home Assistant Links</div>
<div class="HelpBody">
This page is used to define the connections between the Cathedral app and the Home Assistant Serer. Each element in the left column corresponds to a part of the 
Cathedral interface.  The center column indicates what Home Assistant sensor, entity or other element is used to provide information to Cathedral.  The right 
column gives examples of what to look for when searching the list of available Home Assistant objects.<br />
<br />
Links that are not populated will not be shown in Cathedral.  Some aspects of Cathedral require many links (such as the Weather content), whereas others require few 
or none.<br />
<br />
In addition to the Home Assistant, anywhere from zero to four additional pages can be added to Cathedral using data from external websites.  These websites are 
presented on their own page, and should be formatted (by the remote website) to work within the confines of Catheral's 1280w by 400h display.
