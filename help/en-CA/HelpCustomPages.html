This is a custom URL included in Cathedral, used to directly display information from external websites.  The content shown is generated entirely from outside Cathedral 
and Home Assistant, and any issues with the content should be directed to the website that is linked to here.<br />

Anywhere from zero to four Custom URL web pages, like this one, can be added to Cathedral.  These are set in the Home Assistant Links section within the 
Configuratino pages.
